<p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu/index.php">Technology and Social Behavior</a>, a joint program in computer science and communication at <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in Evanston, IL. This year, I am also a <a href="http://segal.northwestern.edu/programs/graduate/phd-program/">Segal Design Cluster Fellow</a>. Currently, I work with <a href="https://egerber.mech.northwestern.edu/">Dr. Elizabeth Gerber</a> in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> to understand how online crowds can be leveraged to give useful feedback to web designers.</p>
<p>I have a bachelor's degree from <a href="http://www.linfield.edu">Linfield College</a> in cognitive psychology and media studies. While I was the lead UX researcher at <a href="http://www.piktochart.com">Piktochart</a>, I helped develop a culture of design thinking among graphic designers, web developers and marketers. My research interests are related to developing technology that improves the way people innovate, research, and design.</p>

<p>As a Segal Design Cluster Fellow, I am running a quasi-experiment to understand how design experts and novices differ when they make sense of online feedback comments. Ultimately, these findings can help us design more effective, crowd-powered online feedback tools for designers.</p>
<p>Below are some of my other recent projects.</p>

<a id="crowdfeedback-a-survey-and-taxonomy-of-a-growing-field" class="anchor" href="#crowdfeedback-a-survey-and-taxonomy-of-a-growing-field" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online Feedback Exchange: A Framework for Understanding the Socio-Psychological Factors</h3>
<p><strong>Method: Literature review, design-based research, user testing, experiment</strong></p>
<p>Online feedback exchange (OFE) systems, including online communities such as Adobe's Behance and usability testing websites such as UserTesting, enable visual designers to receive timely feedback at little cost and at scale. However, we know little about the effectiveness of these websites in helping designers improve their work, particularly because some feedback is less useful or specific than others. With Dr. Liz Gerber and in collaboration with <a href="http://spdow.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Steven Dow</a> and <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bpbailey">Dr. Brian Bailey</a>, I am helping to research and design a feedback tool that will help new designers get quick and high quality feedback from crowds of online users. I recently co-authored a paper that was accepted to the conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'17), outlining a framework of socio-psychological factors that need to be addressed when designing a crowd feedback system for end-to-end design. I have also received the Segal Design Fellowship this year to study the role of framing when designers attempt to make sense of feedback. My hypothesis is that designers make more significant improvements to their work when they transfrom feedback comments into user-specific goals, rather than product-specific goals. The results of this study will help us design more intuitive and helpful systems for interface and interaction designers.<br>

<p><strong>Method: Field observations, surveys</strong></p>
<p>From March to September 2016, I was part of <a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/people/mikehorn/">Dr. Mike Horn's</a> research team that redesigned digital reading rails at <a href="https://fieldmuseum.org/">the Field Museum of Natural History</a> in Chicago. I contributed design ideas, tested prototypes, collected video and audio data from museum visitors, and learned how to calculate key success metrics. Our goal was to prompt deeper learning conversations about artifacts in the Cyrus Tang Hall of China. The preliminary work on this project will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the <a href="http://www.aera.net/Events-Meetings/Annual-Meeting/2017-Annual-Meeting-Call-for-Submissions">American Educational Research Association (AERA '17) in June 2017.</a></p>

<p><strong>Method: Pilot studies, proposed online experiment</strong></p>
<p>Many platforms exist today that make large tasks possible by crowdsourcing smaller micro-tasks. However, the people who engage in such crowdwork face unstable employment and less-than-enriching work environments. With Dr. Liz Gerber and Dr. Steven Franconeri, I am interested to know how crowdwork could be made more valuable to workers. We started exploring a way for crowdworkers to learn about graphic design by being paid for their feedback on other designs. We wanted to know if workers can develop expertise on these platforms and what types of features would make this possible.<br>

<p><strong>Method: Participant observation, interviews</strong></p>
<p>For a class on field methods, I started conducting participant observations and interviews at <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hack Night</a>, a weekly civic hack night in downtown Chicago. I was interested in learning what motivates people to volunteer their time to solving tough societal problems with tech, as well as how a group of unrelated individuals explore a problem space. I was part of the Access to Justice group that is trying to connect disparate resources in the city to help the formerly incarcerated adapt to life outside prison. </p>
