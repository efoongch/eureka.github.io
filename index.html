<a id="hi-my-name-is-eureka" class="anchor" href="#hi-my-name-is-eureka" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi! My name is Eureka.</h1>
<p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Technology and Social Behavior, a joint program in computer science and communication at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. This year, I am also a <a href="http://segal.northwestern.edu/programs/graduate/phd-program/">Segal Design Fellow</a>. My research interests are related to developing technology that improves the way people innovate, research, and design. </p>
<p>My bachelor's degree is in cognitive psychology and media studies. While I was the lead UX researcher at Piktochart, I helped develop a culture of design thinking among graphic designers, web developers and marketers. My goal is to someday radically improve the way we conduct research, connect research to practice, and design human-centered solutions.</p>

<p>Currently, I work with <a href="https://egerber.mech.northwestern.edu/">Dr. Liz Gerber</a> in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> to understand how online crowds can be leveraged to give useful feedback to web designers. To create a framework of design considerations for these systems, I reviewed literature in learning science, design pedagogy, organizational science, and online communities. More specifically, I am developing a study to understand how expert and novices make sense of design feedback online. Ultimately, my findings will contribute to the development of a crowd-powered online feedback tool for designers. </p>

<p><strong>Method: Literature review, design-based research, user testing, experiments</strong></p>
<p>Feedback is an important part of a designer's toolkit, but it is difficult for designers to know who to ask for feedback, what to ask, and to do so face-to-face. With Dr. Liz Gerber and in collaboration with <a href="http://spdow.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Steven Dow</a> and <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bpbailey">Dr. Brian Bailey</a>, I am helping to research and design a feedback tool that will help new designers get quick and high quality feedback from crowds of online users. I recently co-authored a paper that was submitted to the conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'17).</p>

<p><strong>Method: Field observations, surveys</strong></p>
<p>Most recently, I was part of <a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/people/mikehorn/">Dr. Mike Horn's</a> team that redesigned digital reading rails at <a href="https://fieldmuseum.org/">the Field Museum of Natural History</a> in Chicago. I contributed design ideas, tested prototypes, collected video and audio data from museum visitors, and learned how to calculate key success metrics. Our goal was to prompt learning conversations about museum artifacts.</p>

<p><strong>Method: Pilot studies, proposed online experiment</strong></p>
<p>Many platforms exist today that make large tasks possible by crowdsourcing smaller micro-tasks. However, the people who engage in such crowdwork face unstable employment and less-than-enriching work environments. With Dr. Liz Gerber and Dr. Steven Franconeri, I am interested to know how crowdwork could be made more valuable to workers. We started exploring a way for crowdworkers to learn about graphic design by being paid for their feedback on other designs. We wanted to know if workers can develop expertise on these platforms and what types of features would make this possible.<br>

<p><strong>Method: Participant observation, interviews</strong></p>
<p>For a class on field methods, I started conducting participant observations and interviews at <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hack Night</a>, a weekly civic hack night in downtown Chicago. I was interested in learning what motivates people to volunteer their time to solving tough societal problems with tech, as well as how a group of unrelated individuals explore a problem space. I was part of the Access to Justice group that is trying to connect disparate resources in the city to help the formerly incarcerated adapt to life outside prison. </p>
