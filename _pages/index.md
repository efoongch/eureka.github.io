## Hi! I'm Eureka 👋

<p>I am a User Experience Researcher at YouTube in Google Switzerland 📹🇨🇭. I lead research on Creator Music, a new feature that will expand creators' access to copyrighted music (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/youtube-announces-creator-music-a-new-way-for-creators-to-shop-for-songs-for-use-in-videos/">read on TechCrunch</a>). My strengths are in mixed-methods research on new products, combining quantitative data with rich qualitative insights and aligning teams to achieve user-driven goals.</p>

### Past Work

<p> Before YouTube, I was a researcher studying online work, the gig economy, and gender equity. Most recently, I was in Japan doing a postdoc at <a href="https://www.tc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">Tokyo College</a> in the University of Tokyo, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cyber.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kuzuoka/index.html">Dr. Hideaki Kuzuoka</a> in the <a href="http://www.cyber.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">Cyber Interface Lab</a> and Dr. Naomi Yamashita at NTT. I was also a Visiting Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)</a> with <a href="http://www.lauradabbish.com/">Dr. Laura Dabbish</a>. I earned my PhD in <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu/index.php">Technology and Social Behavior</a> at <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> under <a href="https://egerber.mech.northwestern.edu/">Dr. Elizabeth Gerber</a> in the Delta Lab. </p>

<p>Before that, I led UX research efforts on the AI User Research team at Facebook and at online design tool, <a href="www.piktochart.com">Piktochart</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: In college, I loved producing videos and made one award-winning educational video for Noba Psychology (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMPIWkFtd88&feature=emb_imp_woyt">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/eyewitness-testimony-and-memory-biases">Noba Psychology</a>). So, I'm really stoked to be working with creators! 🤩</p>

### Outside of Work 

<p>You can find me exploring Switzerland, practicing guitar, dreaming of Penang laksa, taking dance/yoga classes, or looking for a beach! よろしくお願いいたします。🎸🩰🍜🏞️ </p>
