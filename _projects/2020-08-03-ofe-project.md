## Online Feedback Exchange and Career Development

Online feedback exchange (OFE) systems are an increasingly popular way to test concepts with millions of target users before going to market. Yet, we know little about how users make sense of this feedback and how this feedback could be used to support freelancers, who must constantly improve their online portfolios to develop successful careers. In my research, I developed a framework for thinking about the socio-psychological factors in OFE systems, highlighted novice-expert differences in making sense of online feedback, and designed a crowdsourced feedback tool, CrowdFolio, to help freelance designers' understand how others' view their work.
